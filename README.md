# Face Rig Feature
The Lab now supports importing a face rig which drives the many shape keys available. The rig is intiuitive and easy to use. All you have to do is after you finalize the character, click on the "Create Face Rig" button, which will setup the face rig for you.

It's not parented to the head bone, so it can be moved by using the root bone to any location. Alternatively, you can parent it to the head bone of the main character rig, and then it'll copy the rotation/location of the bone.

Here is a short video to show how to use the rig:

# Future Development
I'm researching adding a phoneme rig to facilitate lip synching animation. The lab currently has that, but it's not simple to use for animation. The idea is to streamline the lipsynching animation process. In addition, I'd like to add a feature which can take an audio clip description json file and create a first pass lipsync animation.
